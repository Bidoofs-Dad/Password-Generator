# Password Generator!

## About The Application

So how this application works (or is suppose to), is by randomly generating you a password based off of some criteria that you yourself choose to include or not! It will bring you through multiple prompts asking;

* How many characters you would like the password to be (minimum 8 and maximum 128)

* If you would like to include Lower Cased Letters

* If you would like to include Upper Cased Letters

* If you would like to include Numbers

* If you would like to include Special Characters

From there it would in theory, generate you a random password based off of your input, pretty cool!

## Issues

I definitely ran into some issues when writing this up, such as;

* Figuring out the proper prompt structure format to display the multiple questions.

* When making the Special Character array, it seemed to not like including the " and ' values, we quickly solved that part though.

* The biggest issue of all though, the unsolved bit of the code, my study group couldn't crack the random generator part of the code, and most things I've seen online seem to go with the ES6 format of JavaScript.

* I kept stumbling across the code "math.floor(math.random() * randomPassword.length)" but really was not sure how to use it, I have a feeling this is a vital part in the randomizer though.

So all in all, issues wise, I am really happy with how much my study group was able to accomplish when putting our heads together! I just wish we had learned about the random generator code in class instead of having to solve that part for ourselves.

## Screenshots

I'll include some screenshots below (10 to be exact, sorry for so many), just showing that the prompts at least work! I'll also include one of the password box after all prompts have been completed (Where the random password should be).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I enjoyed this project a bit, I just wish we had been better equipped to handle this specific task, or been given a bit more starter code to solve the randomizer part. I am very happy with the progress my group and I have made though, its a pretty cool thing seeing those prompts respond properly!
